Get your forex trading realtime Info



Hi everybody 
This is a little python script can check your current forex trading and price of your position when opened.

its can be useful for someone need check her position status and calculate how much win or loos, in the general condition we need open broker website or portal and see what happened, but mybe its get so many time to open broker website 10 or 20 or more in the day, this script can only show you two number every second update status and there is current price of example EUR/USD  and price of your possition/order when you opened.
